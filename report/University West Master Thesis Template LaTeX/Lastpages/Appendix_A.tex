\section*{A. Appendix}
The appendices gather everything that is not necessary, for the reader, to be able to follow and understand the main part of the report. An appendix might include detailed information such as tables of measured data, calculations, program codes etc. It can also include figures that are too large to insert in the text. An appendix is an independent document and pages are numbered separately from the rest of the document or other appendices.\\
Extensive program listings or measurement sets are usually not ok even for an appendix. It is impossible to read and interpret.  These are usually best distributed as files and cannot be part of the degree report. If you work together with a company, make sure that any pictures or data presented are approved by the company to be published.\\
