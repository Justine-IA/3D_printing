\section{Method}
The method section will guide the reader on how the degree work was carried out. It describes the method step by step and usually in chronological order.  Which research methodology is being used \cite{ResearchMethodology}.\\
As an example of things to mention:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Justify the choice and benefits of your method
    \item In what chronological order the operations conducted
    \item How data collection and experiments were carried out
    \item Development of models
    \item Specific tools, equipment or other resources used
    \item What are the sources of error and error margins 
    \item How many experiments where made
\end{itemize}
A normal mistake is to write this section as a “diary”, avoid this in a report. It is also possible to include the method as a subsection to the introduction. Talk to your supervisor about this.
