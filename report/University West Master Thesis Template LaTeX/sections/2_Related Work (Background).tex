\section{Related work (Background}
This section deals with the theoretical background, for a master degree project. This section is important and must exist. It must consist of theories and facts that the project is based on, with references to relevant literature. This is to prove that the writer has enough knowledge to attack the real problem later, a more scientific approach than ad-hock. It must also provide the reader with good background information to understand the problem area. The purpose of this section is to deepen the reader's knowledge. It may include formulas, facts about technologies or equipment. Any statements, formulas or fact must be supported by a good reference.\\

\section{Something}
Today it is easy to find references that are web-based from a University, companies and popular sites such as Wikipedia. Avoid as far as possible these kinds of references. After two-three years, the reference might be dead and pointless. It is also much harder for the writer to grade the quality of “free information”. For a degree project at a master level a maximum of three web links (if any). It is much easier and better to refer to peer-reviewed articles, [1] and [2]. Peer-reviewed articles and standards have been evaluated by qualified persons to determine quality and suitability before publication [3]. This will help the writer (and the reader) to “trust” the content in a reference.\\

\section{Something}
Try to focus on related work, what others have done in the area before, and how it relates to the current study. In some cases, it is not possible to find a reference for a specific detail. It’s then important to “zoom out” and search broader. Maybe search for a parallel domain that has the same theory base. All degree projects must include good references and it is always possible to find, discuss with your supervisor. A decent level is 10-20 scientific references for a master degree project. A literature study must always be carried out and is usually not addressed as a part of the method.
