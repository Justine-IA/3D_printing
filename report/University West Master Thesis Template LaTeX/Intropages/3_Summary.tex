\section*{Summary}
The student must write a summary with a short background and the major results and conclusions . A summary presents all the major elements of the thesis in a highly condensed form and should therefore not exceed half a page. A common error is to fail in presenting the result. The main purpose of the thesis is to explain your discovery and how you reach that, not all steps you did present as a diary.
